\chapter*{Summary}
This document presents the outcomes of the internship conducted by Marco Bernardi at Breton S.p.A, spanning approximately three hundred hours. 
The internship encompassed various objectives, the first of which involved conducting a feasibility study on the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating lifelike marble textures. 
Following the confirmation of feasibility, the subsequent goal was to develop a model capable of generating marble textures with a notable level of realism and diversity. 
Lastly, the final objective involved integrating the model into fundamental software designed for the creation of marble textures.
